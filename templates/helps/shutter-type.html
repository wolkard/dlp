In addition to shutter support through GCode, it is also possible to wire the shutter directly to Raspberry Pi GPIO.<br>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Servo Motor: By wiring the pulse pin of the servo motor to GPIO you can control the shutters directly.</li>
	<li>True/False: Makes GPIO HIGH and LOW suitable for magnetic shutters or to separate the shutter control boards.</li>
</ul>
